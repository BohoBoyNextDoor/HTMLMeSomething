                <h2>Overview of Story</h2>
                <p>"As I lay dying was written by William Faulkner in 1930. This is a novel which defies classification. Simultaniously a coming-of-age story and an exploration of the harsh realities of rural life, this tale is as much about the overarching concepts of the human condition as it a sardonic take on traditional heroic ideas, such as the Odyssey.
                The plot largely revolves around a family addressing the rapidly failing health of the mother, Addie. Cash, her son, builds a coffin outside her window whilst she still breathes, and the remainder of the family struggle with her slow passing each in their own way -- notably Vardamon, her youngest son, is unable to process her death in abstract,
                and instead relates it the death of the fish he killed earlier. Later in the story, we uncover dramatic sexual exposition betwixt different charactors which betrays social and class related nuance of the times, and we continue exploring the sociopolitical scene when, while journeying to bury Addie in Jefferson, they stay with another family.
                all the while, the reader is confronted with the concept of bravery and chivalry for its own sake and constantly asked why even bother."</p>

                <h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
                <p>My preschool years were spent crawling around in a four-family flat on Arsenal, half a block east of Grand and Tower Grove Park. I do have some memories from these years, including hot summer nights with the windows open and a fan on high, trying to piece together dinner that didn't involve turning on the oven or stove.</p>

                <h2>Fenton, MO</h2>
                <p>From age 5 to 18 I live in a suburb on the far southrn edge of the St. Louis metropolitan area. It was just what you probably expect: subdivisions, baseball teams, big box stores, and lots of TV. Most of my fond memories from these years involve my family. Pictured here are my brother, mother, and grandfather.</p>

                <h2>Kirksville, MO</h2>
                <p>From 2000-2005 I was an undergraduate at Truman State University, a little-known but quite wonderful public liberal arts school in northern Missouri, a few minutes drive from the Iowa border. The permanent population of Kirksville was roughly 15,000, while the school had an enrollment of 6,000. Needless to say, it wasn't much of a traditional college town. But the town had character, and was small enough to make a car almost completely unecessary on a day-to-day basis.</p>

                <p>During my undergrad years, I spend 5 months studying in England. Technically, I lived in Hampton Wick, a southwestern suburb of London that sits along the Thames and is walking distance from Hampton Court Palace, home of Henry VIII.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 2003, I lived in this small town about halfway between Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan. Summers in Michagans are a dream, with their long days, relatively mild temps, and plenty of outdoor recreation at close access.</p>
                <p>While there, I worked with students and faculty at Grand Valley State University working on mathematics research, the result of which is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268894955_When_lines_go_bad_in_hyperspace">my only published research paper</a> to-date.</p>

                <p>I lived in Lincoln, Nebraska in the summer of 2005, preparing for graduate school, which would start that fall. I lived with about a dozen other math students in the dorms, which were otherwise empty (as was much of this college town).</p>

                <h2>Long Island, NY</h2>
                <p>From 2005 to 2008 I lived in a few towns on the north short of Long Island: Stony Brook, Port Jefferson, and Sound Beach. At the time, I was a graduate student at Stony Brook University. This part of Long Island is about 60 miles east of New York City (about 2 hours by train or car to Manhattan), but feels like a world away. The coastline is beautiful, and the east end of long island closely matches the expectations created by movies and literature of an idyllic, quaint stretch of small towns, farms, farm stands, and beaches.</p>

                <p>We come to the present day. After leaving New York in 2008, I returned to St. Louis, this time planing my feet within the city limits for the first time. Over the years I lived in a few different parts of the city, including Dogtown and Old North, but I've spend the majority of my time in the city in the Cherokee / Jefferson area, at various apartments in Benton Park and Gravois Park.</p>

                    <h4>Germany</h4>
                    <p>Across two different trips, I've spent a total of 6 weeks in Germany. My first trip was a month-long backpacking excursion in 2003 that took my travel companion and I through most major regions of the country. We spent time in Heidelberg, Mahneim, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Köln (Cologne), and Frankfurt.</p>I returned in 2009 to spend two weeks visiting my friend and college roommate in Munich, where he was working as a physicist.<p></p>

                    <p>I never occupied a residence in New York City, but I spend countless days in the city while living on Long Island. The days were an even mix of trips to the city to take classes at Columbia University (where my advisor had a visiting position), seeing live music, and visiting friends in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
