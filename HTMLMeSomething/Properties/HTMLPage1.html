                <h2>Overview of Story</h2>
                <p>"As I lay dying was written by William Faulkner in 1930. This is a novel which defies classification. Simultaniously a coming-of-age story and an exploration of the harsh realities of rural life, this tale is as much about the overarching concepts of the human condition as it a sardonic take on traditional heroic ideas, such as the Odyssey.
                The plot largely revolves around a family addressing the rapidly failing health of the mother, Addie. Cash, her son, builds a coffin outside her window whilst she still breathes, and the remainder of the family struggle with her slow passing each in their own way -- notably Vardamon, her youngest son, is unable to process her death in abstract,
                and instead relates it the death of the fish he killed earlier. Later in the story, we uncover dramatic sexual exposition betwixt different charactors which betrays social and class related nuance of the times, and we continue exploring the sociopolitical scene when, while journeying to bury Addie in Jefferson, they stay with another family.
                all the while, the reader is confronted with the concept of bravery and chivalry for its own sake and constantly asked why even bother. The ending scene shows the father, Anse, introducing his new bride, a woman he met while getting shovels to bury his previous wife."</p>

                <h2>Intro to Themes</h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the aforementioned themes are incredibly important to this story, such as relationship between entering and exiting the world. The unique perspective of this story, however, is that childbirth isn't a pure, beautiful "white-linin" idea, but rather, due to the stained and corrupted nature of our world and the human condition being
                    drenched in original sin, childbirth is portrayed as both an obligation and shameful act. Addie is feels obliged to birth her children out of a sense of shame and guilt over Jewell's -- her bastard son-- very existence. We see childbearing and birth percieved negatively again with the case of Dewey -- the family's sole daughter. Her pregnancy
                    with the eternally "off-screen" Lafe is presented as a stigma and stain upon her family, and similarities are drawn between her and her mother; both of whom are societally forced to atone for deviations from norms, with the callous Lafe giving her $10 for her to get an abortion. Another important theme is fluxuation of identity and role. This
                    seems familiar to most who enjoy coming-of-age novels, and yet this, too, is shown under a harsh and cynical light. Whereas most see change as beautiful -- especially in regards to maturation -- this is shown to be disasterous for most characters. In fact, the only character who remains fairly steadfast and stable is Cash, who is shown to be
                    inflexible and not a particularly human example. Vardamon fails to confront the concept of his mother's change of state and is only able to view it through the paradigm of dehumanization. His mother "...is a fish." and, thus, has lost her humanity. He is unable to comprehend the differentiation of life and death and this haunts him. Addie, for her
                    part, remains in the same state -- dead -- for the whole story, save for flashbacks. However, as we see her through other characters' eyes, she seems to be in a near constant state of flux. She even offers additonal expose on grim realities of life when she states that the "...reason for living [is] to get ready to stay dead a long time". A final 
                    example of transformation is the ending scene, when Anse introduces his new wife as Mrs. Bundren almost as soon as the previous Mrs. Bundren was in the ground.

                <h2>Intro to famous quotes</h2>
                <p>
                    We've already explored the opening line "my mother is a fish", but the associated quote “Jewel’s mother is a horse,” Darl said.
                    “Then mine can be a fish, can’t it, Darl?” I said.
                    . . .
                    “Then what is your ma, Darl?” I said.
                    “I haven’t got ere one,” Darl said. “Because if I had one, it is was. And if it was, it cant be is. Can it?”
                    offers more exposition and, although allowing the characters to retain simplicity forcibly being associated with their statuc and class, it gives a chance to
                    see that these characters are tackling the issue as best they can and even applying a form of logic to the important theme of change and impermanance. Continuing
                    in this vein, we have Vardamon stating "“I am not crying now. I am not anything.” further cementing the confusion the child feels. The final quote we'll examine is
                    “It takes two people to make you, and one people to die. That’s how the world is going to end.” which is present in an effort to expose the pessimism felt by all.

                <h2>Information of Faulkner</h2>
                <p>Taking, for a moment, a brief respite from discussing the novel itself, I'd instead like to focus on the idea that no art is created in a vaccum and address Faulkner and
                his influence on this work. The book is written in a stream-of-conciousness style and many characters are far more verbose in inward monolgues than externally. Constantly
                shifting narrators each present their own ideas, concepts, and points of view on each issue and many tackle the same problems from different backgrounds and show similar
                responses, which leads many to conclude that there are no alternatives but to participate in life like this. He wrote this book near the end of his life, and I feel that
                some of the pessimism and emphasis on death is reflective thereof. As a legacy, this book fully realized the experimental techniques of stream-of-conciousness and inner-
                monologues, however it must be mentioned that, while he helped pioneer this, many female authors additonally used these techniques and were less praised due to sexism.</p>

                <h2>Important symbol, or, the coffin</h2>
                <p>The only symbol we'll focus on today will be the coffin which is built by Cash for his dying mother while she still lives, and it is built directly outside of her window. This coffin is a symbol of Cash's dedication to his mother, and a monumnet to the ultimate farce of life. Even though Cash tries his best, the coffin is still unbalanced and reflects the issues of the family. Perhaps most importantly, this coffin is a physical
                manifestation of the burden Addie is on her family. So unhappy with her life, she beseeches her family to bury her near her blood relatives despite being so far away during bad
                weather. She is placed into the coffin upside down, and even small acts of kindness go awry, such as when "airholes" are added to coffin, but accidently go through her skull instead..</p>
